Here are some scripts you might find useful for SUSE Manager clients, expecially when building labs or demos

prep-and-clean.sh   - removes either salt-minion or venv-salt-minion if installed, and sets hostname; works on SUSE or RH-derivatives
machine-id-refresh.sh  - Removes and sets the /etc/machine-id using dbus and systemd tools
two-gb-swapfile-create.sh  - creates a persisting 2GB swapfile on /
